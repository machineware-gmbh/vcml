# Virtual Components Modeling Library (vcml)

The Virtual Components Modeling Library contains a set of SystemC/TLM modeling
primitives and component models that can be used to swiftly assemble system
level simulators for embedded systems, i.e. Virtual Platforms. Its main design
goal is to accelerate VP construction by providing a set of commonly used
features, such as TLM sockets, Interrupt ports, I/O peripherals and registers.
Based on these design primitives, TLM models for frequently deployed components
are also provided, such as memories, memory-mapped buses, UARTs, etc.
