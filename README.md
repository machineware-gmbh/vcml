# Virtual Components Modeling Library (vcml)

The Virtual Components Modeling Library offers a comprehensive collection of
SystemC/TLM modeling primitives and widely used component models. Its core
mission is to assist and accelerate the development of system-level simulators
for embedded systems, commonly known as Virtual Platforms.

Based on VCML's key modeling primitives, such as TLM sockets, interrupt ports,
I/O peripherals, and registers, a diverse range of TLM models, including memories,
memory-mapped buses, and UARTs, are provided.
